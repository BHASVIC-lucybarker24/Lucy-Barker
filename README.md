My personal repository

My name is Lucy Barker I am about to go into my second year of college. I study maths, economics and computer science. After college I hope to go to university to study Finance and Data analysis. I am interested in banking roles in the future specifically in investment banking. I am planning on doing work experience at Natwest over the summer to gain some real life experience in what the finacial workforce is.

I am currently working on my course work project which is analysing womens football and unpicking data to find the current best players in the world overall and by position. For my project I am planning to use Python as it is frequently used for analysis so will be the best program to use for my idea. My end goal is to create a program that contains all data needed for the WSL so it can be looked at before, during and after games to help viewers of the sport enjoy it more by knowing which players to look out for or who to look up after the game. 

I am yet to get any qualifications or certifications for Computer Science however I was entered into to national problem solving competion at the start of the year. 

I think during my time on the computer science course so far I have displayed good teamwork skills whilst improving my problem solving skills at the same time. This has been done through the group projects or presentations we have had this year such as the legistations presentation and the hotel kashyyyk.
