My personal repository

My name is Lucy Barker I am about to go into my second year of college. I study maths, economics and computer science. After college I hope to go to university to study Finance and Data analysis. I am interested in banking roles in the future specifically in investment banking. I am planning on doing work experience at Natwest over the summer to gain some real life experience in what the finacial workforce is.

I am currently working on my course work project which is analysing womens football and unpicking data to find the current best players in the world overall and by position. For my project I am planning to use Python as it is frequently used for analysis so will be the best program to use for my idea. My end goal is to create a program that contains all data needed for the WSL so it can be looked at before, during and after games to help viewers of the sport enjoy it more by knowing which players to look out for or who to look up after the game. 

I am yet to get any qualifications or certifications for Computer Science however I was entered into to national problem solving competion at the start of the year. 

I think during my time on the computer science course so far I have displayed good teamwork skills whilst improving my problem solving skills at the same time. This has been done through the group projects or presentations we have had this year such as the legistations presentation and the hotel kashyyyk.  

### My Projects

My first inderpendent project was the C Chapters: This started off just learning basic programming skills used in C. But each chapter increased in difficulty until it got to chapter 8 which was subroutines. Not only did I quickly develop my C skills I also learnt other helpful programming skills such as commenting and spotting logic and syntax errors. I found the arrays the most difficult to learn in C so that took me the longest. 

With the skills learnt from the C chapters we started our first group project which is written in C. In my group we deligated the tasks into three sections: Check in, Checkout and Resturant. My section was Checkout. This mostly envolved working out the total cost of the room for the customers but it still allowed me to use my C skills to good use. 

In the spring term we moved onto Java which envolved learning object oriented programming which I struggled with at some points. During these tutorials we learnt the basics of OOP aswell as inheritence, polymorphism and encapulation. We completed a series of tasks similar to the C chapters to prepare us for our next project in the summer. 

Our summer project envolved creating the game animalopoly. In my group we split the tasks into classes and I wrote the dice and player class which included lots of attributes and methods that were then used on the main board. Overall I think anaimalopoly really improved my understanding of OOP.
